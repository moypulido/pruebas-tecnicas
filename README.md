# Technical Challenges — Portfolio

Repository containing a collection of small challenges and exercises intended to showcase skills in algorithms, data structures, and programming logic. Suitable for inclusion in a technical portfolio as demonstrations of problem solving and coding style.

## Repository structure

- Search and Sorting/ — classic implementations
- leetCode/ — LeetCode problem solutions
- mauridev/ — kata-style challenges
- math/ — mathematical problems

## Goals

- Present concise, clear solutions to algorithmic problems.
- Provide runnable examples that are easy to review.
- Serve as a base for tests, optimizations, and explanations for a portfolio.

## Requirements

- macOS / Linux / Windows with Python 3.8+ (Python 3.10+ recommended).
- UV module for virtual environments (optional but recommended).
- (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```
  UV run --active -m venv .venv
  source .uv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
  .uv\Scripts\activate      # Windows (PowerShell/CMD)
  ```

## How to run

- Run a specific file:
  ```
  uv run "path/to/filename.py"
